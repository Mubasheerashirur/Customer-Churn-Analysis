# Customer-Churn-Analysis
Analyzed 90,000+ customer records to identify churn patterns using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn). Developed a Random Forest Classifier, achieving 69% accuracy for churn prediction. Performed EDA, data preprocessing, categorical encoding, and feature scaling for better model efficiency.
