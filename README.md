# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction (using Python,Machine Learning and Power BI)
## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze customer churn patterns and predict churn using machine learning. A Random Forest Classifier was built with 69% accuracy, and Power BI dashboards were developed to visualize key trends. This helps businesses identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.

## Dataset Used:
- <a href="https://github.com/Mubasheerashirur/Customer-Churn-Analysis/edit/main/README.md">DataSet</a>

## Questions (KPIs):
- What is the total number of customers? 
- What is the overall churn rate (%) among customers? 
- What is the customer retention rate (%)?
- What is the average customer tenure (in months)? 
- What is the average internet usage (GB) of customers? 
- How does the contract type (multi-year, yearly, monthly) impact customer churn?
- What are the preferred payment methods among churned customers? 
- How does the churn rate (%) differ by gender? 
- What is the overall churn rate (%) among customers? 
- How does the churn rate (%) vary based on subscription length (months)? 
- How does the churn rate (%) differ by gender? 
- How does internet usage (GB),customer impact churn rates?

  ## Project Insights:
- Analyzed 90,000+ customer records to identify key factors influencing churn.
- Built a Random Forest Classifier with 69% accuracy to predict customer churn.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn).

 ## Conclusion:
The Customer Churn Analysis revealed key factors influencing churn, such as contract type, payment method, and subscription length. By analyzing 90,000+ records, a Random Forest model     achieved 69% accuracy in predicting churn. Power BI dashboards provided insights into trends across demographics, helping businesses identify at-risk customers. The findings highlight the importance of data-driven strategies to improve customer retention and reduce churn.
