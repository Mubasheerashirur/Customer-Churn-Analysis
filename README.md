# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction (using Machine Learning and Power BI)
## Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to analyze customer churn patterns and predict churn using machine learning. A Random Forest Classifier was built with 69% accuracy, and Power BI dashboards were developed to visualize key trends. This helps businesses identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.
